what need to be done?

login and sign up pages
1= data validation for email and password fields
2=

chat pages
1 ok = i need to fix the slider to open the chat list and close it properly so the typing bar will get full width when the chat list is closed 
2 ok = i need to make a can use the chat without registering
so it will be like an empty account just to use the chat 
without registering if the user want to register later they can do that
but the chat cannot be saved and the signup option will be shown
3 ok = i need to make the chat name cearted
automatically based on the idea of the chat, like when a user start a chat about "How to MAKE a V60"
the chat name will be " V60 making " not like when the user sau hi the chat name will be "hi" it does not make sense
4 ok = in the chat page when the user click on the chat name it will show the account details like email and the date of creating the account
6 ok = the phone user interface need to be fixed to be more user friendly, like the chat list slider and the chat input field AND the size of the text
7 ok = when the user wants to rename of delete the chat it will ask for confirmation before doing that in the chat page, not a popup window
